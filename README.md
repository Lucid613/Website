========================
First log, did some work on a template for the main page of the web page. 
Interactive bubble design.
One main bubble at the start, with 4 bubble detaching from the main one. 
4 Main categorize for the website:
	- About us:
		Details about who we are and what we intend on giving out to our users and fans.
		Brief descriptions of how we met and what inspires us to do what we are doing.
		Maybe a couple pictures of us or our logo to show what we look like.
		
	- Music:
		This tab will have either an embedded soundcloud/hearthis player or if we can
		build a player ourself /*would be pretty cool*/ integrated in this category. 
		This tab can also branch out to our Mech page. /*Maybe we should rename the music tab?*/.
		I also would like to have this page have either favourites tab for a weekly/monthly 
		updated list of our favourite songs and upcoming artists to look at. 
		/*This could be a feature integrated later*/
		
	- Faqs:
		Pretty much says it for itself, frequently asked questions and answers to stuff that 
		we want people to know about us. Not sure about the layout for this one but we could 
		brainstorm a couple things and look at examples.
		
	- Contact:
		This page I have less experience with but whoever knows php/python for emailing form 
		you're on this page. I was thinking pretty basic stuff, Name, Email, Subject, Message. 
		Again, not sure about the layout.
		
Each bubble could branch out to a sub field about that category, not all bubble needs to be but I'm sure we can
find stuff to branch out to. Also I personally would like the animation for clicking on a bubble to go as the 
following:
	-User click on a bubble, ALL bubbles retract to the middle in a bouncy motion. All bubble stack on top of each
	other and shrink to nothing and then whichever bubble the user click on the specific wrapper comes up. Now I
	haven't thought of what each wrapper would look, I'd like to keep each somewhat similar, but each have their
	own settings and style.	
	
Now I have no idea how to actually code this lol (at this point I think you should probably try using Python.
You'd be using it for netsec and it's good for web development, both serverside and user side. It's good
practice.), but I know its possible if we put our heads together and bring out all our artistic skills. 
I can try and do some of the designs on Photoshop. Eric I know your decent at drawing stuff out on paper, 
but also any of you can and I can replicate it digitally. I'm down to use Github for this project since I want to start learning it and I think this is a perfect start to learning it. 

Use this document to keep the team updated and simply use the format I used up top there for the logging
date and person. I'm pretty pumped to see what we can come up with and this can be something we can put on our resumes.
Just give a log if you have ideas and stuff, I'd like to try and keep this semi professional since this is a business
David and I want to start and we want you guys to be part of it! I attached a image of what I did in the plane of
what I would maybe want it to sort of look like. This was made with my touch pad, so its really shitty but 
it give you a semi idea of what I was looking to do. Obviously I'm up for suggestions so write it down here.

Give feedback!
========================

* You should really get this going again! Just start with a "How to build a website in Python" google search. Udacity has a good course on the topic. Python may not be absolute best but Google's engines are build in a lot of Python and the skills will translate to other things you'll be doing in Python :0
* If you do get this going again, I suggest building up your repo's wiki. It's a tab on your repo beside 'Clone' and 'Pull Request'.
